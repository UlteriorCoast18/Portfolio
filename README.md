# Portfolio Cristo Alvarado

## Description

The following is a Portfolio with several projects developed in different languages by Cristo Alvarado (UlteriorCoast18). Each folder has the name of a Programming Language and inside them, is a project whose primary language is the one of the folder which is inside of.

Inside each project folder there is a detailed description of it.

# Projects in Python

There is project developed in this language and two in construction.

## Book Worm

Book Worm is a project developed in **Python** and **SQLite** with the aim of providing the user with an application to organize the digital books in their computer.

## Booklet Maker

Booklet Maker is a project developed in **Python** with the goal of providing a tool for users to crop, join, resize and prepare PDF's. The main functionality of the project is prepare a PDF for booklet type impresion, that is, prepare it to bookbinding. The project is still in construction but there are some previews of the project:

</p>

### PDF Selection

First thing is you have to select some PDF to start working, when selected the program will give a preview of the PDF to edit:

</p>

### Cropping

To Crop a PDF, first we have to select a PDF and then, we click on _Start Cropping PDF_. After that the program will show an overlap of the first 10 pages of the PDF to give the user an impression of the area that's gonna be cropped from the PDF (each page of it). Then te user can select the desired area to crop, as shown in the next picture.

## Rubik's Cube Solver

# Projects In C

There are two fully developed projects in **C**:

## Dijkstra Labyrinth

The project is an implementation of Dijkstra Algorithm in **C**. The program generates a maze with walls shown as the character an entry called _E_ and a exit called _S_. By default the size of Labyrinth is 30*30 (in some test cases it can go up to 200 by 200, but the console has a difficult time showing it).

First, the program generates the maze:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/djikstra_1.png" alt="Screenshot of the program intial execution when generates the maze" style="width: 60%; height: 60%"/>
</p>

Then, the program display's the shortest path between _E_ and _S_.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/djikstra_2.png" alt="Screenshot of the program intial execution when solves the maze" style="width: 60%; height: 60%"/>
</p>

The program is really efficent, not taking longer than a second to solve the maze.

**Further Implementarion**: Give the user an option to choose the size of Labyrinth.

## Visual Ordering

This program is greatly inspired in this video by Timo Bingmann:

The program replicates some of the sorting algorithms in the **C** console. Here's a video of the execution:

# Java

There is one project developed in Java.

## Distributed Chess

The project is a Java Application that's basically a Chess game played by two computers on the same local network.

In construction...

# Javascript

## Local Chess

The project is a local chess game in browser. This project was made using **HTML** and **Javascript**.

  <img src="/assets/images/local_chess_1.png" alt="Screenshot of the web page in the middle of a game" style="width: 60%; height: 60%"/>
</p>

The game detects when a movement cannot be done by the player, by allowing him just to go in the green places. For example, here the black king can only move to the squares in green:

</p>

When a pawn gets to the end of the chessboard, the program will allow the user to select the promotion piece.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/local_chess_3.png" alt="Screenshot of the web page when pawn is being promoted" style="width: 60%; height: 60%"/>
</p>

Finally, the game will end when a player checkmates the other one. In this case, the chessboard will block and to replay again, the user has to reload the page.
